# Parsing Partition Files 

### Parsing Partitions manages data partitions by reading partition data, analysing its structure and implementing efficient partitioning/standardisation algorithms to handle the data.


My final working ParsingPartitions program is within TheEtude1.py, rather than etude1.py which is another approach. 

To compile and run my program, enter:

python3 TheEtude1.py < testFileName.txt > output.txt

My test cases are within testIn.txt through to testIn7.txt. Outputs match to expected.
